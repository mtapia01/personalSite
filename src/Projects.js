                <p className='padding'>
                    Developed a Bio Secure Scheduler for Agrecom, a water treatment, sanitation, and pest control company. 
                    Agrecomâ€™s workers are required to follow strict quarantine restrictions when going from one job site to the next. 
                    Consequently, schedules need to be created with these constraints in mind, which is currently a manual and time-consuming process. 
                    Using customer, job, and employee information inputted by a user, an optimal schedule can be generated that follows all of the necessary constraints.

                The Student Enrollment Web App streamlines student and teacher interactions. 
                Students can easily log in, view classes, explore available courses, and enroll in open classes. 
                Teachers manage classes, enrolled and grades, while the admin oversees all aspects ensuring data control.

                    While adhering to the introductory scope of graphics concepts, the game features a user-controllable object and autonomously moving entities, engaging players in interactive gameplay. 
                    The collaborative effort within the group involves diverse tasks, from implementing core game logic to designing classes for drawing elements and defining behaviors of in-game entities. 
                    Leveraging object-oriented concepts, particularly polymorphism, the project demonstrates a creative fusion of graphics programming and game development, delivering an immersive and entertaining gaming environment.

                    Before the UC Merced course registration redesign, there was no way to get notified for an open seat.
                    Using a web scrapping library, the scrpit would refresh throughout the day to check for availability in a course.
                    Once a seat is open an email would be sent to my account with a link to the course and course ID to register.
